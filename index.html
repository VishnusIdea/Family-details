      <font color="red" size="+2">Families are a blessing not everyone is fortunate enough to have.
         However, those who do, sometimes do not value this blessing.
         Some people spend time away from the family in order to become independent.<br>

         However, they do not realize its importance.
         Families are essential as they help in our growth.
         They develop us into becoming a complete person with an individual identity.
         Moreover, they give us a sense of security and a safe environment to flourish in.<br>
